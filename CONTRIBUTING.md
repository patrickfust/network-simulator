# Welcome to Network Simulator contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

This guide provides repository-specific information to supplement the official contribution documentation.

## New contributor guide

For repository-specific setup, read the [README](../README.md) file. The official docs site also provides these helpful resources:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Contribution types and what we're looking for

Content we accept:
* Technical and grammatical corrections
* Typo fixes
* Expanded explanations of existing products or features, when the expansion has a compelling reason
* New content filling important gaps in our documentation.

Content we do not currently accept:
* Edits purely for tone, readability, or efficiency
* Topics that are too niche or a matter of personal preference
* Changes to the underlying site and workflows

These are general guidelines, but if you’re not sure what category your proposed change would fall under, feel free to open an issue to discuss it with us!

## Getting started

### Writing style guidelines

When contributing content, please follow these key principles:

- **Clarity and simplicity**: The goal of our writing style is clarity and simplicity.
- **Meaning over grammar**: Grammatical correctness is important, but not as important as clarity and meaning.
- **Second person**: The docs use second-person ("you") to communicate directly with readers.
- **Inclusive language**: Use inclusive language by not assuming gender or ability level, and by avoiding slang and idioms.
- **Accessible technical language**: Jargon is sometimes necessary, but don't assume every reader has your technical expertise.
- **Active voice**: Use active voice wherever possible. Active voice means avoiding "be" verbs like "is" or "are" when you can, but also choosing more dynamic verbs to get your point across. "Press (a key)" is less dynamic than "tap (a key)," for example.
- **Clear terminology**: Avoid technical abbreviations like "repo" and "PR," and Latin abbreviations like "i.e." and "e.g."
